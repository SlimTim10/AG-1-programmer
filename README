The zapp project was created using IAR Embedded Workbench 6.0 and is compiled using the following settings:
    General Options
        Device: MSP430F5310
        Hardware multiplier: Allow direct access
        Data Model: Small
        Floating-point: 32 bits
        Stack size: 300
        Data16 heap size: 160
    C/C++ compiler
        Language: C
        C dialect: C99
        Language conformance: Standard with IAR extensions
        Optimizations Level: Low
    Debugger
        Driver: FET Debugger
        FET Debugger
            Connection: Olimex USB
            Debug protocol: Automatic selection
            Target VCC: 3.3
            Flash erase: Erase main and Information memory

The current schematic is identical to that of project bender, but with microphone analog output added as input to VCC_SD_HALF.

The current user interface consists of a single button. A button hold turns the device on. The device begins logging microphone data to a circular buffer located on the FAT16-formatted microSD card (the first 5 file clusters after the directory table). A button tap during this state causes a file to be created with its audio data being a copy of the circular buffer's data. Subsequent button taps cause new files to be created in the same manner. A button hold turns the device off.

The current audio file format being used is WAVE at 8 kHz sample rate, 8 bits per sample, single-channel (mono).
